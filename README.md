Stay prepared for emergencies with the SOS Light app.

Activate the SOS signal with a single tap to send a distress signal in Morse code (three short signals, three long signals, and three short signals again). The app blinks the screen and flash accordingly, making your distress signal visible even in low-light situations. Stop the signal easily when help arrives or the situation stabilizes. Simple, effective, and potentially life-saving.
